Zarrcade is a web application for easily browsing, searching, and visualizing collections of [OME-NGFF](https://github.com/ome/ngff) (i.e. OME-Zarr) images. It implements the following features:

* Automatic discovery of OME-Zarr images on [any storage backend supported by fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#other-known-implementations) including file system, AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, Dropbox, etc.
* MIP/thumbnail generation
* Web-based MIP gallery with convenient viewing links to NGFF-compliant viewers
* Searchable/filterable metadata and annotations
* Neuroglancer state generation for multichannel images
* Build-in file proxy for non-public storage backends
* Integration with external file proxies (e.g. [x2s3](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/x2s3))

## Getting Started

### 1. Install miniforge

[Install miniforge](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniforge.html) if you don't already have it.

### 2. Initialize the conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate zarrcade
```

### 3. Create OME-Zarr images

If necessary, convert your image(s) to OME-Zarr format, e.g. using bioformats2raw:

```bash
bioformats2raw -w 128 -h 128 -z 64 --compression zlib /path/to/input /path/to/zarr
```

If you have many images to convert, we recommend using the [nf-omezarr Nextflow pipeline](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/nf-omezarr) to efficiently run bioformats2raw on a collection of images. This pipeline also lets you scale the conversion processes to your available compute resources (cluster, cloud, etc).

### 4. Import images and metadata into Zarrcade

You can import images into Zarrcade using the provided command line script:

```bash
bin/import.py -d /root/data/dir -c mycollection
```

This will automatically create a local Sqlite database containing a Zarrcade **collection** named "mycollection" and populate it with information about the images in the specified directory. 

By default, this will also create MIPs and thumbnails for each image in a folder named `.zarrcade` within the root data directory. You can change this location by setting the `--aux-path` parameter. You can disable the creation of MIPs and thumbnails by setting the `--no-aux` flag. The brightness of the MIPs can be adjusted using the `--p-lower` and `--p-upper` parameters.

To add extra metadata about the images, you can provide a CSV file with the `-i` flag:

```bash
bin/import.py -d /root/data/dir -c collection_name -i input.csv
```

The CSV file's first column must be a relative path to the OME-Zarr image within the root data directory. The remaining columns can be any annotations that will be searched and displayed within the gallery, e.g.:

```csv
Path,Line,Marker
relative/path/to/ome1.zarr,JKF6363,Blu
relative/path/to/ome2.zarr,JDH3562,Blu
```

To try an example, use the following command:

```bash
bin/import.py -d s3://janelia-data-examples/fly-efish -c flyefish -m docs/flyefish-example.csv
```

### 5. Run the Zarrcade web application

Start the development server, pointing it to your OME-Zarr data:

```bash
uvicorn zarrcade.serve:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload
```

Your images and annotations will be indexed and browseable at [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000). Read the documentation below for more details on how to configure the web UI and deploy the service in production.


## Documentation

* [Overview](./docs/Overview.md) - learn about the data model and overall architecture
* [Configuration](./docs/Configuration.md) - configure the Zarrcade service using settings.yaml or environment variables
* [Deployment](./docs/Deployment.md) - instructions for deploying the service with Docker and in production mode
* [Development Notes](./docs/Development.md) - technical notes for developers working on Zarrcade itself


## Known Limitations

* Zarrcade has so far only been tested with OME-Zarr images generated by the [bioformats2raw](https://github.com/ome/bioformats2raw) tool.
* The `OmeZarrAgent` does not currently support the full OME-Zarr specification, and may fail with certain types of images. If you encounter an error with your data, please open an issue on the [Github repository](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/zarrcade/issues).
